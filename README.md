# Zabbix_SSL_TLS_check

It's a custom template by Ihor Romanyshyn based on https://github.com/selivan/https-ssl-cert-check-zabbix script. The script must be placed at the ExternalScripts directory defined in the `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf` file. Usually it's `/usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts`.

Feel free to ask me something about this in Telegram (https://t.me/iromanyshyn). I'll try to make this template better and more useful soon.
