# Zabbix_SSL_TLS_check

It's a custom template by Ihor Romanyshyn from freedom-loving Ukraine, made for own projects. This template is based on https://github.com/selivan/https-ssl-cert-check-zabbix script. The script must be placed at the `ExternalScripts` directory, usually defined in the `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf` file. Usually it's `/usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts`, but can differ on your installation.

Feel free to ask me something about this. I'll try to make this template better and more useful soon.
